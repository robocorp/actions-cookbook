1. You can hide a private logic on server side.
2. You can enforce the game to follow rules.

In this maze game example we introduce how to:

1. Store game state on server side
2. How to prompt the custom game GPT to use a game server.

To run this use `action-server start --expose`.

Connect this as an action to your custom GPT.

Paste the following gaming prompt instructions for the GPT:

Enable Dalle access and the Actions. Disable all the other tools.
